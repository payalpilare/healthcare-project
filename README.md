# The Health-care Project
The healthcare project focuses on leveraging Python programming and data analysis libraries to conduct an in-depth exploration of a health dataset and develop a predictive model for stroke prediction. The dataset contains information about individuals, including demographic details, lifestyle factors, and health metrics.
The predictive model demonstrated promising results in identifying potential stroke cases based on the provided dataset. The insights gained from the exploratory data analysis contribute to a better understanding of the factors influencing strokes in the population under study.
